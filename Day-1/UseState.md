`useState` is a function that takes an initial value as an argument and returns an array with two elements:

- **State value**: The current value of the state.
- **Update function**: A function to update the state value.


**useState Lifecycle Methods:**

- **Initialization** : When `useState` is called with an initial value.
- **State Update** : When `setState` is called to update the state.
- **Render** : When the component is re-rendered due to state changes.
