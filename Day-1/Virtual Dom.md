  

The Virtual DOM  is a lightweight in-memory representation of the real DOM. It's a key feature of React that enables fast and efficient rendering of UI components.

**How Virtual DOM Works:**

- **Virtual DOM Creation**: When the state of the application changes, React creates a new Virtual DOM tree.

- **Diffing**: React compares the new Virtual DOM tree with the previous one to determine what changes need to be made.

**Benefits of Virtual DOM:**

- **Fast Rendering**: Virtual DOM reduces the number of DOM mutations, resulting in faster rendering.

- **Efficient Updates**: Only changed components are updated, minimizing unnecessary re-renders.

- **Improved Performance**: Reduced DOM mutations lead to better performance and less memory usage.



**Diffing Algorithm**: React's algorithm for identifying changes between Virtual DOM trees.
